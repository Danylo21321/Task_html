    Star Wars is an American epic <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space opera <sup>[1]</sup></a> multimedia
    franchise created by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas">George Lucas</a>, which began with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)">the eponymous 1977 <sup>film[b]</sup></a> and quickly became
    and quickly became a worldwide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture">pop-culture</a> phenomenon.
    The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme
    park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[c]
    In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.
    The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V:
    The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy.

    Lucas later returned to the series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II:
    Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney,
    relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015),
    Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

    All nine films of the "Skywalker Saga" were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases.
    Together with the theatrical live action "anthology" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the
    films equated to over US$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[3][4] An additional film,
    Rogue Squadron, is planned for December 22, 2023 release. A number of other films, including an independent trilogy,
    are suggested to be in development.
